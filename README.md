# Digit-Image-Classification
Image classification system for handwritten digits 0-9

This is the capstone project based on machine learning. The model used is a convolutional neural network.

Capstone Project 	              	                 2022           Project: Image Classification
Description: Python project that takes images of hand written digits and uses machine learning to determine the digit value. The algorithm used the MNIST dataset to create a convolutional neural network using the Keras and TensorFlow python libraries.  
Technologies: Keras, TensorFlow
